# Web Application Development and Security in Microservices Architecture
Web application development has evolved significantly alongside the growth of internet technologies. Modern web applications are expected to be scalable, maintainable, and secure while serving millions of users simultaneously. One architectural approach that supports these requirements is microservices architecture. Microservices divide applications into smaller independent services that communicate with each other through APIs. While this approach improves flexibility and scalability, it also introduces new security challenges that developers must address.

## What is Web Application Development?
Web application development refers to the process of designing, building, and maintaining applications that operate through web browsers. These applications typically consist of two main components:

1. Frontend Development
Frontend development focuses on the user interface and user experience. It involves technologies such as:

- HTML for structure
- SS for styling
- JavaScript for interactivity
- Frameworks such as React.js or Vue.js for dynamic UI components

2. Backend Development
Backend development manages data processing, business logic, and server communication. Popular backend technologies include:

-Node.js
-FastAPI
-Django
-Spring Boot

The backend usually connects to databases and exposes APIs that allow the frontend to communicate with the server.
